<P>Some have been led astray from the faith.​—1 Tim. 6:10.The expression “led astray” indicates that we could become distracted by trying to acquire unnecessary possessions. We could then expose our heart to “many senseless and harmful desires.” (1 Tim. 6:9) Rather than allowing those desires into our heart, we must see them for what they are​—weapons that can harm us. Suppose we have the financial means to buy many material things. Are we doing something wrong if we purchase things that we want but do not actually need? Not necessarily. But reflect on these questions: Even if we can afford to buy something, do we really have the time and energy to use and maintain the item? Also, might we become overly attached to our possessions?</P>

<p>Could our attachment to material things cause us to act like the young man who turned down Jesus’ invitation to expand his service to God? (Mark 10:17-22) How much better it is for us to lead a simple life and spend our precious time and strength in doing God’s will!</p>
